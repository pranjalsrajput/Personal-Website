## Description
A novel dataset has been collected that is recorded using unconstrained smartphone cameras and capturing a wide range of interesting scenarios. After recording the data, post-processing of the data is done. Also, extra information of the participants is scrapped from the official website of the event. A few benchmarking tests are done on the collected dataset. The annotation of the dataset is still in process. The dataset will be released later to promote research in the field of computer vision. Not much information regarding the dataset can be revealed at this point due to GDPR restrictions.
